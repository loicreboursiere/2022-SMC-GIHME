@article{Kehling2014,
abstract = {In this paper we present a novel algorithm for automatic analysis, transcription, and parameter extraction from isolated polyphonic guitar recordings. In addition to general score-related information such as note onset, duration, and pitch, instrument-specific information such as the plucked string, the applied pluck-ing and expression styles are retrieved automatically. For this pur-pose, we adapted several state-of-the-art approaches for onset and offset detection, multipitch estimation, string estimation, feature extraction, and multi-class classification. Furthermore we inves-tigated a robust partial tracking algorithm with respect to inhar-monicity, an extensive extraction of novel and known audio fea-tures as well as the exploitation of instrument-based knowledge in the form of plausability filtering to obtain more reliable pre-diction. Our system achieved very high accuracy values of 98 {\%} for onset and offset detection as well as multipitch estimation. For the instrument-related parameters, the proposed algorithm also showed very good performance with accuracy values of 82 {\%} for the string number, 93 {\%} for the plucking style, and 83 {\%} for the expression style.},

  abstract  = {When they improvise, musicians typically alternate between several playing modes on their instruments. Guitarists in particular, alternate between modes such as octave playing, mixed chords and bass, chord comping, solo melodies, walking bass, etc. Robust musical interactive systems call for a pre- cise detection of these playing modes in real-time. In this context, the accuracy of mode classification is critical because it underlies the design of the whole interaction taking place. In this paper, we present an accurate and robust playing mode classifier for guitar audio signals. Our classifier distinguishes between three modes routinely used in jazz improvisation: bass, solo melodic improvi- sation, and chords. Our method uses a supervised classification technique applied to a large corpus of training data, recorded with different guitars (electric, jazz, nylon-strings, electro-acoustic). We detail our method and experimental results over various data sets. We show in particular that the performance of our classifier is comparable to that of a MIDI-based classifier. We describe the application of the classifier to live interactive musical systems and discuss the limitations and possible extensions of this approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel method to detect and distinguish ten frequently used audio effects in recordings of electric guitar and bass. It is based on spectral analysis of audio segments located in the sustain part of previously detected guitar tones. Overall, 541 spectral, cepstral and harmonic features are extracted from short time spectra of the audio segments. Support Vector Machines are used in combination with feature selection and transform techniques for automatic classification based on the extracted feature vectors. With correct classification rates up to 100{\%} for the detection of single effects and 98{\%} for the simultaneous distinction of ten different effects, the method has successfully proven its capability - performing on isolated sounds as well as on multitimbral, stereophonic musical recordings.},

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.
